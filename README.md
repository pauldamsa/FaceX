# FaceX - Edge Computing

FaceX is a `personal project` that allows you to get information about `people emotions` based on `their face`.

The purpose of this project is to show you a demo of how a system like this can be used. The project is intended to work on the edge devices like Raspberry Pi 4 and others.

## Setup
Describe how to install / setup your local environement / add link to demo version.

## Code Examples
Show examples of usage:
`put-your-code-here`

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Based on the emotions frequency the app shows you a bar chart.

To-do list:
* Improve the performance of the model
* Get relevant data for trainig
* Get quality data 

###### The application doesn't have some complex features, because it wasn't the purpose.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, because the purpose of the project was to get more knowledge about Edge Computing and ML tools. However, for more development this project is a good start point.

## Inspiration
The project was built for improving my machine learning and data science skills. Also, the inspiration was brought by a very good friend of mine who has a in-depth vision in this field.
